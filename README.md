# What is this?

BukkitPE is software for hosting Minecraft : Pocket Edition servers. From controlling everything you can possibly do on MCPE to everything players can ever imagine on a server, BukkitPE also has an API which lets developer extend it. Let's face it plain MCPE Server's isn't fun :P That's mainly why we have an API. BukkitPE has Clean feels and Stable Features / Performance optimization.

**Note:** There are still bugs left with latest 1.0.8 update. Please report bugs on the issue section.
